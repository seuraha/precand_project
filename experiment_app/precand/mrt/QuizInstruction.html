<p>In the first section of the experiment, we ask you to complete a quiz with 15 questions.</p>

<p>You will see a pattern with one cutout missing.
    Your task is to choose the correct cutout from four suggestions and press the Next button.</p>
<p>You have 30 seconds to select the correct answer for each pattern and click the Next button.</p>
<p>
    The additional payment for each correct question is ${{ C.PIECE_RATE|to2 }}.
    Additionally, the computer will draw a random prize between $0.00 and $1.00 and add it to the payment.
    For example, suppose that you got 5 out of the 15 questions correct, and the computer drew a random prize of $0.50.
    Then, the additional payment from this section is ${{ C.PIECE_RATE|to2 }} X 5 + $0.50 = $1.50.
</p>
<p>On the following page, you can answer a practice question to familiarize yourself with the format of the quiz.</p>
