<p>The test you have just taken is an <b>intelligence test (IQ test)</b>.
    All participants have seen exactly the same questions, and in the same order.</p>
<p>The computer has randomly assigned you to a group of 4 with other U-M students,
    and your score on the IQ test has been evaluated relative
    to the participants in that group.</p>
<p>In a little bit, we will ask you to estimate the percentage chances
    that you have been ranked 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in your group. The question will look as follows:

<br><br>
<p>You will have the opportunity to win 1 dollar using the same payoff mechanism
    that we explained at the beginning of the experiment (please consult the leaflet if you need to).
    This means that you maximize your payoff when you give your best estimate.</p>
<p>If the case occurs that two participants in the group have the same score, the computer randomly decides which participant has the higher or the lower rank.</p>

<br>
<p>Before you proceed to the next page,
    please answer the following comprehension quiz. This quiz is not counted in the final payoff.</p>
