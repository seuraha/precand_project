    During the experiment, you will give your estimates for the percentage chances
    of <b>four different scenarios of an event.</b>
    The percentage chance that you will report will influence your earnings.
    For each estimate task, you can receive an additional payoff of 1 dollar.
    The payoff mechanism is designed such that you have the highest chance
    of receiving an additional payoff of 1 dollar when you report your best estimate.
</p>
<p>
    In the following, we will explain the payoff mechanism in detail.
    We will use the event <b>“the number of rainy days in Ann Arbor in September 2021”</b>
    as an example. This example is for <b>illustrative purposes</b> only
    and will be replaced by another event in the experiment.
</p>
<p>
    Assume in the following that there are four possible scenarios
    for the “number of rainy days in Ann Arbor in September 2021,”
    and that exactly one of the scenarios has occurred.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><u>Scenario A</u>: In September 2021, Ann Arbor had less than 7 rainy days.</li>
    <li><u>Scenario B</u>: In September 2021, Ann Arbor had between 7 and 9 rainy days.</li>
    <li><u>Scenario C</u>: In September 2021, Ann Arbor had between 10 and 11 rainy days.</li>
    <li><u>Scenario D</u>: In September 2021, Ann Arbor had at least 12 rainy days.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In the experiment, we would ask you to give your estimate
    for the chance of the occurrence of each respective scenario.
    Since only one of these scenarios has occurred,
    the sum of the probabilities would need to add up to 100%.
</p>
<p>
    After you have made your estimate for the different scenarios,
    the computer will randomly select exactly <b>one scenario</b> as payoff relevant.
    This selection is random and does not mean that this scenario occurred.
</p>

<p>
    The computer then randomly selects <b>a number X between 0 and 100.</b>
    The percentage chance to be selected is equal for each number.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Payoff</h3>

<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>If your specified percentage chance for the selected scenario is
        at least as high as the number X,
        then you will receive a dollar if the scenario has occurred.</li>
    <li>If, on the other hand, your specified percentage chance
    is lower than the number X, then you receive a dollar with a chance of X%.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>According to these rules, it is always beneficial for
        you to report your best estimates.
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    For example, assume that your best estimate for the percentage chance
    of scenario A is 50% and you specify a chance of 30%.
    Then it can happen that the computer selects scenario A
    for the payout and the number 40 is taken for X.
    In this case, your chance of winning one dollar is 40%. If you had entered 50%,
    you would, according to your best estimate,
    win the one dollar with a percentage chance of 50% -
    exactly when scenario A occurred.

<br>
<br>
<p>
    In order to increase your understanding of the payoff mechanism,
    we now ask you to answer some practice questions on the next page.
    We will use the example above,
    “the number of rainy days in Ann Arbor in September 2021.”
    Your answers to these questions will not affect your payouts in the experiment.
    However, we will not proceed to the next phase of the experiment
    until all participants have answered the questions correctly.
    You may consult the leaflet we provided during the experiment.
