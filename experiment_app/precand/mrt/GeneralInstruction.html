<p>The experiment consists of four sections.
    In each section, you will first read the instructions and perform different tasks.
    Your payment will be determined by your decisions,
    so please read the instructions very carefully.</p>

<p>Please make sure that your mobile phone is switched off.
    During the experiment, it is not allowed to communicate with other participants,
    use mobile phones, or start other programs on the computer.
    If you violate this rule, we must exclude you from the experiment and all payments.</p>

<p>If you have any questions at any point during the experiment,
    please raise your hand. An experimenter will come to your station
    and answer your questions quietly.</p>
