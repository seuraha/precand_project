    <p>The following practice questions relate to the exemplary event "the number of rainy days in Ann Arbor in September 2021" with the following four scenarios:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scenario A: In September 2021, Ann Arbor had less than 7 rainy days.</li>
    <li>Scenario B: In September 2021, Ann Arbor had between 7 and 9 rainy days.</li>
    <li>Scenario C: In September 2021, Ann Arbor had between 10 and 11 rainy days.</li>
    <li>Scenario D: In September 2021, Ann Arbor had at least 12 rainy days.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Assume that your best estimate for the percentage chances of Scenario <i>A</i> is 50%, Scenario <i>B</i> is 30%, and Scenario <i>C</i> is 15%.</p>

    {{ formfield "belief_comp1" }}
<br>
<p>Suppose that you reported your best estimates and the computer has randomly selected
    Scenario <i>C</i> (for which you estimated a 15% chance of occurring)
    and randomly picked <i>X</i> to be 25.</p>
