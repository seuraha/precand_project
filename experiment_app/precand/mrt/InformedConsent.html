    <span class="weight600">Successful completion clause</span>:
    Participants who successfully complete the study will receive payment.
    <i>Successful completion</i> is determined at the discretion of the experimenter
    using common methods to identify <i>non-genuine responses</i>.
    Examples of non-genuine responses include nonsense answers,
    responses completed in an extremely short or long amount of time,
    failure to respond to instructions,
    and/or otherwise clearly failing to offer genuine responses.
    Participants should complete the study in one sitting without interruptions
    to help ensure their response is not considered as non-genuine.
    Only submissions considered genuine will receive payment.<br>
